To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Using Terminal:

Open two terminal windows or tabs in the root directory of the project.

In the first terminal, navigate to the frontend directory by typing:
"cd frontend"

In the second terminal, navigate to the backend directory by typing:
"cd backend"

In both terminals, install dependencies by typing:
"npm i"

After installation completes, start the development servers in both terminals by typing:
"npm run dev"

Using Visual Studio Code (Optional):

Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

Open two integrated terminals from the Terminal menu.

In the first terminal, type:
"cd frontend"
"npm i"
"npm run dev"

In the second terminal, type:
"cd backend"
"npm i"
"npm run dev"

This will start both frontend and backend servers in development mode.
