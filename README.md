Running the Project
To run the project locally, please follow the instructions below:

Using Terminal
Open two terminal windows or tabs in the root directory of the project.

In the first terminal, navigate to the frontend directory by typing: "cd frontend"

In the second terminal, navigate to the backend directory by typing: "cd backend"

In both terminals, install the dependencies by typing: "npm i"

After the installation completes, start the development servers in both terminals by typing: "npm run dev"

Using Visual Studio Code (Optional)
Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

Open two integrated terminals from the Terminal menu.

In the first terminal, type the following commands one after another:
"cd frontend"
"npm i"
"npm run dev"

In the second terminal, type the following commands one after another:
"cd backend"
"npm i"
"npm run dev"

Both servers will then run concurrently in development mode.
